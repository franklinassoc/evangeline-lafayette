        <h2>A Shared Vision for Economic Revitalization</h2>
        <p>For neighborhoods along the Evangeline Corridor—the 3 miles adjacent to the I-49 Connector—the proposed infrastructural upgrade offers significant opportunities. Increased movement of goods and services will connect the area to broader markets, customers, and suppliers. Additionally, new infrastructure investments are expected to stimulate commerce, enhance the overall livability of the area, and bridge the divide caused by historical policies and projects in the community.​

This Action Plan outlines strategies to coordinate public and private investments triggered by infrastructure improvements. It specifically addresses a range of land use, business development, and quality of life enhancements informed by multi-sector input, aiming to uplift communities holistically and equitably. Together, these initiatives will foster sustainable economic growth, improve the quality of life for residents, and chart a path for shared prosperity.​
