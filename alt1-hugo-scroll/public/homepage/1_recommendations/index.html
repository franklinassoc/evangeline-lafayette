<p>The Economic Action Plan builds on a year-long process of targeted stakeholder and community engagement, economic and technical research, and urban design and planning, integrating multiple past plans and ongoing investments to develop a comprehensive strategy for economic development along the proposed I-49 Connector project in Lafayette, LA.​</p>
<p>​For neighborhoods along the Evangeline Corridor—the 3 miles adjacent to the I-49 Connector—the proposed infrastructural upgrade offers significant opportunities. Increased movement of goods and services will connect the area to broader markets, customers, and suppliers. Additionally, new infrastructure investments are expected to stimulate commerce, enhance the overall livability of the area, and bridge the divide caused by historical policies and projects in the community.​</p>
<p>​This Action Plan outlines strategies to coordinate public and private investments triggered by infrastructure improvements. It specifically addresses a range of land use, business development, and quality of life enhancements informed by multi-sector input, aiming to uplift communities holistically and equitably. Together, these initiatives will foster sustainable economic growth, improve the quality of life for residents, and chart a path for shared prosperity.​</p>

<li><strong>Equitable development</strong>: Promoting inclusive growth with initiatives ranging from small business and workforce opportunities to food access and arts and culture​</li>
<li><strong>Real estate investment</strong>: Planning for 1.5 million SF of new development ranging from mixed-use to infill projects, generating $371 million in direct investment, more than 2,000 construction jobs, and 5-fold increase in City-Parish property tax revenue on project sites​</li>
<li><strong>Retail and business activities</strong>: Supporting $46 million annual business revenue and over 400 permanent jobs​</li>
